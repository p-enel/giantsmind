* Functionalities of the LLM chat:
Why is the LLM used?
- summarize papers
- ask questions about paper(s)
- explain parts of paper

* Need to find what format of text must be fed to the LLM to get the desired output
we want to split the text as much as possible to avoid using long
token sequences which cost more
- Need to find out when papers or parts of papers can be analyzed individually
